# NXU-BAN6420-Module-5-Assignment-Principal-Component-Analysis

The attached Python script has the following features;
* Imported Libraries
* Dataset called 'load_breast_cancer' is loaded from sklearn.datasets.
* The data is displayed using the display() function
* The data is tranformed with Normalization to rescale the data, so every feature has a single unit variance using the Standard Scaler() function from sklearn.preprocessing.
* Dimensionality Reduction is then used to reduce the dataset to a 2-dimensional space using the PCA function from sklearn.decomposition.
* PCA Visualization using a Scatter Plot and a Head Map with interpretations.
* Then Logistic Regression was used for Prediction.
* The Training and Testing data is Defined
* sklearn.metrics is used to display a confusion matrix, accuracy score, precision score, recall score and f1 score.
* A regression plot and Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve are used for Logistic Regression Prediction with interpretation.
